# TabularNN
This repository contains my research work on tools for effectively using **Deep Learning** and **Machine Learning** with **Tabular Data**

## Features:
* Examples using PyTorch [TabNet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) implementation
* FastAI TabularPandas
* XGBoost
* LightGBM
* Hyper-parameters optimization with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)

## Datasets used in examples:
* The dataset used in the competition: [Tabular Playground March 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-mar-2021)
*

## Useful references:
* The theory behind **TabNet** is explained in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442)
